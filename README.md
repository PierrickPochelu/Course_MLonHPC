# Course_MLonHPC
Some materials I developed and co-teach with my colleague O.C.

Layers.ipynb is the file to look at.

Here are some notes about the course flow:
* Previous slides: Logistics regression algo, Big-O notation.
* Layers.ipynb: Common layer algorithms and their respective complexity (compute and memory). Discuss about decomposition when obvious.
* Next slides: 10 design parallel patterns (especially multi-GPU).
* Students are doing projects: coding on HPC some Layers.ipynb (ex: Ensemble of Forecasters on the HPC), using high-level API: PyTorch&Tensorflow/Horovod, HuggingFace/DeepSpeed.
